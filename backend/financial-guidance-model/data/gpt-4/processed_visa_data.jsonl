{"prompt": "What are the financial implications of H-2A/H-2B (Temporary Worker Visas)?", "completion": "Seasonal/Temporary Employment: H-2A (agricultural) and H-2B (non-agricultural) workers earn wages, but jobs are often temporary or seasonal, leading to income gaps. Workers may have to return home during off-seasons. Employer-Sponsored Costs: Many employers are required to cover visa processing fees and sometimes housing or travel expenses, which can reduce the financial burden on workers. However, pay in these jobs can be modest, limiting savings potential. No Access to Public Benefits: H-2A/H-2B workers do not qualify for most U.S. social benefits like unemployment insurance or welfare, which means they rely solely on earned wages. Remittance Expenses: Workers often send money back to their home countries, but high remittance fees can cut into their income."}
