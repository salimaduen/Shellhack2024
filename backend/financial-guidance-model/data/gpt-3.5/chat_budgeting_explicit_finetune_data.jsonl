These are expenses that you must pay each month.\n\n3. **Identify Debt Payments**: Make a list of your debts, including loans and credit card payments. Write down the minimum payment for each debt and subtract that from your income.\n\n4. **Review Your Spending**: Track your actual spending for at least a month. Keep receipts and note every dollar you spend, whether by cash or credit card. This helps you understand your true spending habits and identify areas where you can cut back.\n\n5. **Create a Spending Plan**: Based on your income and expenses, determine how much money is left for discretionary spending. Assign every dollar a specific job\u2014whether it is for bills, debt repayment, savings, or entertainment. This ensures that you stay within your budget.\n\n6. **Set Financial Goals**: Define realistic financial goals. These might include paying off debt, saving for an emergency fund, or stopping overspending. Prioritize the most urgent goals, such as paying down high-interest debt.\n\n7. **Adjust Each Month**: Review your budget monthly. Track whether you have achieved your financial goals, and make adjustments if necessary. If you overspend in one category, cut back in another. A flexible budget will help you stay on track."}]}
